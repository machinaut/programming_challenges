My solutions to some of the problems from IEEEXtreme 2011's programming competition

All the problem names are single letters, and are a single source file.
E.g. Problem A's solution is "a.c"

Example input files are given and appropriate output is also given.
E.g. Problem A's example input is "a.in" and the corresponding output is "a.out"

The solutions can be compiled with gcc
E.g. gcc -Wall -lm -o a a.c

And to test run them
./a < a.in
